# [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#why-not-how)

In a team setting, the team's first approach to its commit log should  
be to first agree on a commit message convention that defines at  
least the **"style," "content," and "metadata."**

The goal of having a clear commit message is to improve collaboration  
and project maintainability. A well-structured message should follow a  
consistent format:

- A short, imperative subject line under 50 characters
- A blank line
- A wrapped body at 72 characters

This makes logs readable and useful for debugging and understanding history.

Commit messages should also explain **what changed and why, instead of how.**  
The subject should be **action-oriented**, avoiding past tense or descriptions.  
The body should provide necessary context, referencing issues or PRs when  
it's relevant.

By following these conventions, teams can ensure clarity and consistency,
making the logs easier to navigate and maintain.
